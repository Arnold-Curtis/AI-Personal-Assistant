User Input: Yea I would love to understand English and in 7 week's time is my meeting.
Final Decision: yes
Response Analysis:
 Actionable: ✅
Timeframe: X weeks → ✅ ≥7d (Assuming 'X' here represents the number of complete weeks)
Conflict: ✅ None ("in 7 week' end" implies no same-day conflict, assuming "end" refers to completion at a time point that does not coincide with any other engagements on the day itself.)
Decision: yes

User Input: I would like to learn German and i have an exam in 4 weeks
Final Decision: no
Response Analysis:
 Actionable: ✅
Timeframe: 28 days → ✅ ≥3d
Conflict: ❌ Same-day (assuming the learning will take place while preparing for other activities)
Decision: no

ASSISTANT REASONING:
The user intends to learn German, which is an actionable verb. The timeframe given is "4 weeks," translating into 28 days, and this meets our requirement of being at least three days away from the decision point (current day). However, since there's no explicit information about same-day conflicts provided by the user regarding studying German while doing other things on the same day, we cannot assume that one exists based solely on what has been said. Therefore, following rule 1 and considering all given conditions are met for "yes" output but lacking clear evidence of a conflict under our specific ruleset (which demands explicit mention), I'm providing 'no'. In real scenarios, it would be vital to have additional context or confirmation about potential same-day conflicts before making the decision.

User Input: Whats up
Final Decision: no
Response Analysis:
I am designed to follow the scoring rules and output only yes or no based on user input. The user input "Whats up" does not provide enough information to begin scoring. I require more details about a task or decision being assessed.

"Understand" is an actionable verb. The timeframe is 7 weeks, which extends beyond 3 days. There's mention of a meeting, but no indication this meeting is urgent or conflicts with the task of understanding English. Priority severity is unclear. Time flexibility is not explicitly mentioned, but the 7-week timeframe suggests some flexibility. Resource availability for learning English is likely. A goal is specified (understanding English), and time is specified (7 weeks during a meeting). No explicit dependencies are mentioned besides showing you can understand at the meeting. It's unclear from the input if that is the measure of success or the meeting is just there to serve as the reason for learning English. There's no historical context provided.

Output:
Thinking Space:
No explicit actionable verb (like "fix" or "treat").
Timeframe: "Today" is a same-day event, being out sick.
Same-Day Conflict: Not applicable, as the sickness explains absence.

Time Flexibility: The mention of the meeting locks the user to meeting.
Resource Availability: It's implied that the resources to fix the light are available (assuming bulbs, tools, etc. are present).
Goal Specificity: The goal of fixing the light is clear.
Dependency Check: It's possible there are dependencies (need to buy a bulb), but those are not mentioned.

Okay, I understand the format. Let's proceed.

**Input:** "Need to fix the printer by Friday, but I am on vacation."

**Thinking Space:**
Actionable Verb: "Fix" is an actionable verb.
Timeframe: The task needs to be completed by Friday, setting a deadline.
Same-Day Conflict: "I am on vacation" suggests a conflict. This potentially blocks the task.
Priority Severity: We don't know how critical the printer fix is, but the explicit mention of vacation suggests a higher priority conflict.
Time Flexibility: Friday is somewhat flexible, but the vacation poses a significant constraint.

"I want to fix my resume today, but have to wait for my manager to give me the updated metrics from last year's performance review. Also, I have a doctor's appointment at 3pm which I can't reschedule as it is the last checkup before my surgery next week."

Thinking Space:
Actionable Verb: "Fix" is an actionable verb. The task is to fix the resume.
Timeframe: "Today" indicates a same-day timeframe.
Same-Day Conflict: There is a doctor's appointment at 3 PM today.

Okay, I understand. You want me to define "it" after having processed a prompt according to the given rules and classifications. "It" in this context refers to the actionability of the given input.

**Thinking Space:**

The prompt doesn't provide any input that needs to be analyzed. It is, in effect, a request for clarification on what "it" means in the context of all the previous rules and examples. Since the prompt itself doesn't describe a task, event, or objective needing assessment, all the initial guiding questions become irrelevant. The prompt does not have an actionable verb, timeframe, potential conflict, nor special case calendar event.
