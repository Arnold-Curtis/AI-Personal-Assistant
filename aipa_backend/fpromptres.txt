User Input: Yea I would love to understand English and in 7 week's time is my meeting.
Final Decision: yes
Response Analysis:
 Actionable: ✅
Timeframe: X weeks → ✅ ≥7d (Assuming 'X' here represents the number of complete weeks)
Conflict: ✅ None ("in 7 week' end" implies no same-day conflict, assuming "end" refers to completion at a time point that does not coincide with any other engagements on the day itself.)
Decision: yes

User Input: I would like to learn German and i have an exam in 4 weeks
Final Decision: no
Response Analysis:
 Actionable: ✅
Timeframe: 28 days → ✅ ≥3d
Conflict: ❌ Same-day (assuming the learning will take place while preparing for other activities)
Decision: no

ASSISTANT REASONING:
The user intends to learn German, which is an actionable verb. The timeframe given is "4 weeks," translating into 28 days, and this meets our requirement of being at least three days away from the decision point (current day). However, since there's no explicit information about same-day conflicts provided by the user regarding studying German while doing other things on the same day, we cannot assume that one exists based solely on what has been said. Therefore, following rule 1 and considering all given conditions are met for "yes" output but lacking clear evidence of a conflict under our specific ruleset (which demands explicit mention), I'm providing 'no'. In real scenarios, it would be vital to have additional context or confirmation about potential same-day conflicts before making the decision.

User Input: Whats up
Final Decision: no
Response Analysis:
I am designed to follow the scoring rules and output only yes or no based on user input. The user input "Whats up" does not provide enough information to begin scoring. I require more details about a task or decision being assessed.

Thinking Process:
Actionable Verb: "Learn" is present, indicating an action.

Timeframe: "4 weeks" suggests a timeframe beyond 3 days but related to an immediate hurdle

Same-Day Conflict: No conflict is explicitly mentioned, but the proximity of the Python exam could be an indirect conflict depending on workload.

Priority Severity: The Python exam is high priority, which may block time for learning java.

Time Flexibility: Not explicitly mentioned, but learning Java can likely be scheduled flexibly around the exam.

Resource Availability: Java learning resources are generally available.

Goal Specificity: "Learn Java" is a reasonably specific goal.

Dependency Check: No immediate dependencies are apparent, although success in the Python exam could improve confidence/time.

Historical Context: Unknown, but irrelevant in making this plan.

User Input: Man I would like to learn java and my python exam is in 4 weeks man
Final Decision: yes
Thinking Process:
*   **Actionable Verb:** Yes, the input contains "learn," which is an actionable verb.
*   **Timeframe:** The python exam provides a clear deadline in 4 weeks, indirectly setting a timeframe for learning Java to potentially complement Python knowledge. It implies learning Java should ideally start sooner rather than later.
*   **Same-Day Conflict:** No same-day conflict is mentioned.
*   **Priority Severity:** The Python exam could be seen as a higher priority, potentially blocking time for learning Java if the exam is demanding, however learning Java and python could synergize, so it is not certain, and there is no immediate conflict.
*   **Time Flexibility:** No specific mention of time flexibility, but the 4-week timeframe suggests there's some flexibility in scheduling Java learning around the Python exam preparation.
*   **Resource Availability:** Resources for learning Java are readily available online and in libraries.
*   **Goal Specificity:** The goal is relatively clear: learn Java. While not super specific (e.g., which framework, for what purpose), it's a solid starting point.
*   **Dependency Check:** There might be assumed dependencies (e.g., having a computer, internet access), but nothing is explicitly blocking the start of learning.
*   **Historical Context:** The prompt does not provide enough information for the historical context of comparable tasks.

User Input: remeber this number ok here is the number 6

Final Decision: yes
Thinking Process:
The verb "remember" is actionable in that it implies an instruction.

The timeframe is implied to be immediate, as the number is being provided now.

No conflicts are mentioned.

No priority severity is implied.

No time flexibility is mentioned.

The resource (the number 6) is readily available.

The goal is specific: to remember the number 6.

No dependencies are mentioned.

We don't have historical context about the person's ability to remember numbers.

User Input: ok so what was the number
Final Decision: no
Thinking Process:
No actionable verb detected. While "what" implies a request for information, the prompt lacks context to determine if fulfilling this request is truly actionable.

No timeframe mentioned, but the prompt suggests it is somewhat immediate.

We don't know if there are conflicts

We don't know its priority.

We don't know if there is any flexibility.

Resources is available as long as the number is accessible.

Goal is not very specific.

Potentially, the task is dependent on someone remembering the number.

Historical context is unknown.

User Input: yes there was a number previously taht i gave you
Final Decision: no
Thinking Process:
While the input mentions a "number previously given," it lacks a clear actionable verb. The prompt doesn't explicitly state what to *do* with that number. There is no timeframe mentioned, nor any indication of conflicts, priority, flexibility, or resources. The goal specificity is vague, as the purpose of remembering the number is unclear. Dependency Check is unclear, is the AI is waiting for further instructions? Historical Context is not addressed in the prompt.

User Input: hey man ild love to learn java man and my birthday is in 3 and 1/2 weeks
Final Decision: yes
Thinking Process:
"Learn" is an actionable verb.

The timeframe is potentially relevant because the birthday is in 3 and 1/2 weeks, which suggests some deadline or motivation related to the birthday, but doesn't necessarily preclude learning Java before then. It's slightly ambiguous as to whether the birthday impacts the learn Java intention.

No immediate conflicts or blocking high-priority issues mentioned.

The goal is to learn Java, which is a reasonably specific goal.

Resources for learning Java should be readily available.

No specific dependencies mentioned.

Historical context is unknown.

The birthday mention provides some context, perhaps suggesting a desire to have some Java skills by then, but doesn't fundamentally make the task non-actionable. I'd err on the side of actionable.
