 To begin learning German with the goal of passing a test in four weeks, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Clear Objectives**: Identify exactly what aspects of the language (vocabulary, grammar, speaking skills) are tested and tailor your study plan accordingly.

2. **Create an Intensive Study Schedule**: Break down your 4-week period into daily or weekly goals. Allocate specific times for focused German practice each day to ensure consistency in learning.

3. **Use a Comprehensive Learning Toolkit**: Incorporate multiple resources such as textbooks, online courses (like Duolingo), language exchange platforms like Tandem, or mobile apps that are designed specifically for intensive grammar and vocabulary acquisition. 

4. **Practice Consistently Every Day**: Dedicate at least an hour every day to study German activelyâ€”reading a passage, writing sentences, listening to recordings, etc. Regular practice is crucial in language learning within such short time frames.

5. **Engage with the Language Actively**: Practice speaking and comprehension skills regularly by conversing with native speakers or using speech recognition software for pronunciation exercises if possible. 

6. **Mock Exams**: Regularly test yourself on various aspects of German to simulate exam conditions, which can help identify areas needing improvement quickly so you know what focus is required in the final weeks leading up to your actual exam.

7. **Seek Feedback and Review Mistakes**: After speaking practice or mock exams, review mistakes for better understanding and future avoidance of similar errors. Seek feedback from native speakers if possible through language exchange partnerships.
