 * 1. Basic Event Creation (straightforward scheduling)
 * 2. Complex Time Expressions (multi-part dates)
 * 3. Ambiguous/Vague Prompts (system robustness)
 * 4. Event Type Recognition (proper categorization)
 * 5. Chained/Dependent Events (follow-up scheduling)
 * 6. Memory Storage Tests (personal information)
 * 7. Edge Cases (error handling)
 * 8. Real-World Scenarios (practical usage)
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is test-only code and should be removed before production!
