**Part 1: Analysis (Thinking Space)**
1. Identify ONLY EXPLICIT elements from the input
2. Categorize EACH element STRICTLY as:
   - Calendar: ONLY if containing time reference (convert ALL to days)

   - Suggestions: ONLY if user explicitly asks for recommendations
3. IGNORE implicit/assumed elements
4. Use bullet points ONLY
5. Required header: "**Part 1: Analysis**" (exactly like this)
